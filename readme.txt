Landsat land surface temperature (LST) derivation script, created by Arthur Elmes with significant contributions from A.J. Shatz.

This tool takes in level 1 and surface reflectance Landsat images to produce LST. It appears to be obsolete as of June 2018,
since NASA will be providing surface temperature products with the Analysis Ready Dataset (ARD). Nevertheless, this script
provides a manual way to calculate LST.
